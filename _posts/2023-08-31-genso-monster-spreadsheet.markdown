<h3>20/06/2023 - GensoKishi Metaworld Monster Spreadsheet</h3>

<p>Below is a blog and contest entry I made for one of the contests that the game moderators made for rewards. Stripping it off my blogger.com which is strictly for my Web3 Play2Earn Stuff.</p>

<blockquote>
I should probably rename this blog to be my Web3 Journey Blog or something. Catchy... XDD
<br>
<br>
But anyway here's a copy pasta of my entry in one of the Filipino Moderator's contest event about one's Genso Journey and why are we going back to the SG Server:
<br>
<br>
Contest Entry for Participitation(I know XD)
<br>
<br>
I never left SG...
<br>
<br>
Although my first choice server was actually JP. I just couldn't get into that server when I started playing. Probably mistook the long loading time as a barrier to entry.
<br>
<br>
The journey's good, it's not done but it's ongoing. Taking this bit to plug in a little tool I made for personal use and the community:
https://docs.google.com/.../1AoOrVXtKCoIY5Fv1FS4s.../edit...
<br>
<br>
It's a monster database search tool that allows users to search, filter and sort list of results of monsters in the game. I'm currently updating the information in line with GameWithNFT's recent update to their lists. UPDATE ! It is updated to the latest GameWithNFT Data dated 4/6/2023.
<br>
<br>
When character server transfer ever do come into the game then I'll probably transfer my SG progress to JP Server. Thinking something along the lines of your characters in JP and SG getting swapped or added together, I have no idea how it would be implemented but really looking for it.
<br>
<br>
Reason is I want to train my Nihonggo language proficiency and eventually visit Japan. Or maybe even work there, LOL, highly doubt it as I see myself more like the type that should be working for Google who can lounge around any time as some say LMFAO.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, you know what we've been through lmao. Shoutouts to my BFFs in-game MDSN, Ziyaaa, Meylin and the lodicakes CrzyPH, Bishopee, Sirs Leaztat, Rygon, Janonits and Madame me.game1 ‚ù§
Kuya Dudoy!! Miss ko na mga pagkanta ni Madame NAPs sa VC and pag emcee niyo...

Okay, Sige legit. What is Toosaka's story really?
<br>
<br>
It all started around December 2022. That time I just moved in to the old home of my passed away grandparents to live with my uncle and save some money from having to pay rent for an apartment. I am not sure but it seems like this area has play2earn players and is probably the reason why GensoKishi Online -Meta World- happened to come by online viewscope and I just checked it out.
<br>
<br>
The earliest event that I remember was having an AMA with madame Ph Purch and other interested in the project people at the time from the Filipino Community. Back then the community don't know much about the persons or each other yet so most of the questions that madame used for a giveaway event that time were basic about the game and structure of the project's people. I won 5$ worth of ROND that time! üòÉ
<br>
<br>
My first character was actually a fighter but I deleted it at around lv12 since I was mostly just trying things out, then I met Ziyaaa, Gimlet who is now Meylin, and Reed/xPulbura and that's when our friendship in-game started. I also switched to a more supportive class to aid this newfound friendship and because I was hearing some little talks about the bishop class being somewhat strong because of it's unique abilities. When I finally became a bishop and got a few levels in and actually beat Main Quest 3-4 solo with barely any NFT and just pots, (Yes, mind you these were the times when Book Rewards had mRond value. I was also there in Discord Voice Comms when somebody shared the exploit about it that botters use.) that's when I started recording footages and testing farming spots to upload to my YouTube channel (BAM! Game is 80% Bishop at this time.). For those videos I had some players know my character and greet me pleasantries in-game at one point it even got a little annoying for me but I think it's fine now, the person has moved on and so have I, I think. Lodicakes Bishopee, CrzyPH, and Daisuke were also the ones I knew as good Bishop players in the community for their sheer strength in being F2P and continuously farming all day and being active in the official channels of the game.
<br>
<br>
It was also around these times that I became a lot more active with the game with the goal of popularizing and building an attractive community foundation for new players to know and adopt the game. I am very bad at video editing as I just don't have the patience to learn as I go when editing unlike when I am programming/coding instead so thankfully our awesome content creators from our country were the ones who spread the news and increased popularity of this game, sir Spraky, Kookoo ‚ù§ I would just be a raw footage distributor from time to time and while playing as bishop would go around resurrecting other players when I do feel like helping around. Because sometimes, especially in SEA Server MMORPGs, I get drained in my socials department by which then I will go solo grinding while ignoring all the chats until I feel better. My reward for all these was a Ramen Card with a special mention from madame Ph Purch's discord announcement of rewarded contributors to the community. ‚ù§ When CrzyPH received his Ramen Card, he sold it and bought himself an awesome Computer Set! Katas ng Ramen! LOL. Ramen Card got sold up to about 800$ that time being it's first release and nobody knew the specifics of what will it really offer in-game that time.
<br>
<br>
So we were all just happily farming and playing gensokishi everyday, solo or partying until the monster patch and job rebalancing patches came! And the drop comparison between JP and SG that led to many SG Players moving to JP Server. I stayed in SG though and decided to pursue my monk in the same character as my bishop. Staying in SG was fine, we were still able to farm for DT and still earn albeit a little. But I had to sell all my lv0 refine NFTs as they were too costly to maintain while farming. I opted to get max refined NFTs instead for the bang for buck. I no longer go around resurrecting players as much as before but I can do it if I have to, just need to switch my character's jobs.
<br>
<br>
And that leads us to where we are now. Ziyaaa now has an IRL Job, and nowadays just complains about how tired she is to even play the game anymore. XD Welp, that's work for ya specially if you're the type to always give it your all. Tiring AF. Remember to put the glass down üòâ Meylin and MDSN are still doing DTs and already had their DT SR gear I think. I mostly solo at Mt. Arroz Yeti with my cleric-based monk while messing with the botters on that map.
<br>
<br>
There's still a few small stories that I haven't mentioned here like my little talk about the game with sir Leaztat at the discord during midnight and getting to know the trio of them(Jano,Rygon,Leaztat).
<br>
<br>
Naofumi whom we thought got hacked that time. I mentioned the Character Code String which at the time doesn't seem to be that well understood much by most of the players because you can duplicate other character names but not that code in combination with char name. How I met MDSN through Ziyaaa's Indonesian playmates ‚ù§ Love our Indo brothers and sisters, indo and pinoy have so much similarities in appearance and I think as people too.
<br>
<br>
I'm still learning about the game too and I continue playing it as if I am hiding my assets and money in the game hoping to be able to someday take some if not all out when I need it. You also earn as you play so it's not a total waste of time.
<br>
<br>
That's it and don't forget to check that Spreadsheet! It would be really helpful in planning and quick referencing. I also submitted it to the creator program ‚ù§
<br>
<br>

And so after this post a lot more stuff happened right?
<br>
My entry won not as a top thing but it did won :D
<br>
I tried to win again but my entry just couldn't compete with the others so sayonara Lando~
<br>
Because you need to win 3 times in a row to be rewarded with the land. And they also actually updated the mechanics now, players can now vote themselves who they want to win rather than the awesome people over at the game publisher deciding. As it should be, player driven and publisher mandated. They also updated the mechanics to the creator program too, haven't read it personally.
<br>
Reason being I am so engrossed right now on this other game that is about to become Web3 Game as well.
<br>
<br>
But before that, I attended the IRL Meetup Event of the game! Yes GensoKishi's IRL Meetup Event here in Philippines! The CEO himself and his fellow heads of the game were there! Thank you so much to Sir Matt whom I felt like I got a little bit of special treatment that is well appreciated by me as it helped get into the mood and not be awkward during the event. XD I felt welcomed! So I used up all my stubs to get as much beer as I can, man I haven't had Red Horse Extra Strong in a very long time mainly because I was actually already avoiding it as it is Too Strong specially for someone like me who mostly just drinks by myself nowadays because we just don't meetup with old friends as often as before now with life and new stuff. The morning after of an Extra Strong Red Horse is also crazy, yo! That thing is insane as a beer, it tastes and feels so good to drink and then kicks you so hard the morning after, I can see why it is so popular with foreigners. So anyway, we got freebies! Powerbank, a beautiful glass etched with the game's logo as a USB Flash Drive, don't forget the stickers and the packaging they came with also had the game's logo. The Genso Girls, yo they we're fire! There was a maid attire girl and a Mona from Genshin Impact cosplaying hot lady. I just had to take a few peeks and glances of course. Arigatou Gozaimas for taking a picture with me..... Yeah, I still don't have a copy of that picture. Hmmmm @v@'' The giveaways! There were raffles and games and I just had to personally talk to the CEO to show my appreciation and amazement at this project. I guess the question that my Indonesian friend who I met in-game through Ziyaaa became a very convenient excuse for me to approach the CEO. So I got pictures of selfies with people who I know in-game as like a remembrance and *ehem* filing because I tend to lose memories of who some people are the more I don't interact with them so if they ever decide to ghost me, I won't completely forget them when I see their file. HAHHA.
Ahhhh!!! While writing this I missed the appointed time to do an in-game event over at my other game. So one more last thing before we move on to talking about that other game. So right now GensoKishi, is pretty hard to play for newbies just planning to be F2P... You can play the game totally for free but it's going to be really hard on your resources early on in the game unless you know what you are doing. The P2E aspect is now locked behind an investment so you have to pay if you want to start earning in the game which makes sense it is becoming a business to earn for playing the game that's kind of akin to money laundering even though it really isn't. But people could abuse it so much that there just had to be regulations on these things. So in the event mentioned in the previous paragraph there was an early chance to do eKYC before it is released to the larger player-base. KYC stands for Know Your Customer which is a verification method like how the government requires that you identify yourself since birth to avail of some it's benefits and tax you and stuff. Like I just wrote, measures against money laundering and also ensuring that we are not aiding or going to be held responsible for like funding illegal stuff. The investment amount required might seem steep but in actuality it is just the right amount as other investments would ask. 100$ is also the recommended starting amount when getting into stocks or brokers here in the Philippines AFAIK.
<br>
<br>
Now onto the other game that I am playing right now that is said to soon be a Web3 game too. Summoner's War: Chronicles! If you want to know more about it then just check it out yourself! It is a gacha game based on the original Summoner's War game which was a gacha game that had PvP! They've been around for a long time now I guess. Back when I first found out about this game, the OG Version, I stopped playing because the graphics was still kind of uninteresting for me and there was just so much stuff because of the gacha and collection aspect that it felt pretty overwhelming for an underwhelming looking game. And I also thought back then that this is Pay2Win Gacha PvP Game. So I just kind of like veered away from it and played Fate/Grand Order instead. I sold my FGO Account for funds into GensoKishi... Yeah. that's about how much I am interested in the GensoKishi project... Hey, I loved that account, it stayed with me for like 5 to 6 years... It's an account, not a child, okay? No malformation of ideas here, please. But anyway this Summoner's War now has a fleshed out much better 3D Graphics and the combat mechanics is no longer turn based but Real Time, like how exciting right!? Now I know this is a gacha game so like how would they turn it into Web3? I have no idea but I can see how there are some things in the game that would reward you with account progression materials if you provide not too easy to obtain in-game resources. I doubt they would make it so that players could just buy off summoning/gacha from other players since that is the main revenue of the game as a gacha game but the other stuff would work I think. There is legit a ton of stuff to do in this game like dailies and so on takes me a good few hours just to complete! So I think the update coming tomorrow is going to aid other players who don't have as much time as players like me. Like rather than having weeklies they'll make it monthly instead. The developers legit listen to the players and I can see why that is I mean this is a gacha game! And successful gacha focused games can really turn up the profits for the publisher.
<br>
<br>
Well anyway that's all from me to this blog for now, till next time!
<br>
PS: Summoner's War Players! Please take note of the fact the Shushu in it's Secret dungeon will back away from you when attack it and how that affects AOE DPS of your team mates....
<br>
PPS: I really need to relocate residences, then maybe look into getting employed again.
