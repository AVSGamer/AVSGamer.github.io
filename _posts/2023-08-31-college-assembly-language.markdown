<h3>Comp. Sci. 3rd Yr. Course - Assembly Lang.</h3>

<p>The following is a link to my requirements passed for the 3rd Yr. Course of Computer Science which is Assembly Language Programming. Assemby language is the closest programming language you get right before the code turns into a bunch of 0's and 1's or pure machine code. Those 0s and 1s are like electric signals of 0 volts and 5 or 3 volts respectively.</p>
