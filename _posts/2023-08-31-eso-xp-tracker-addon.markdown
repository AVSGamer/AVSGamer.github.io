<h3>13/05/2023 - XP Tracker Addon for ESO</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info3072-XPTracker.html">This</a> was my very first and currently still the only addon I have made for this game. I had to learn to use an API in it's development and it was a fun learning process. Glad it at least got about 6k downloads total now, if only that was paid downloads, then I would be making a good amount of money out of it. Sigh. Well, after I'm done setting this website up in an acceptable manner for me, that's my next task.</p>

<p>The addon is a simple UI overlay that is highly cuztomizable and simplistic in it's design. It shows the latest amount of EXP gained by the player and the rate over time of exp based on the most recent time(real-time).</p>

<p>My last time of updating this addon was on May 13 of 2023. Already there's a modder that offered some changes to be made as some things seem to have stopped working over the game's updates since then. I offered to have him co-author the addon with me as I really am quite the free-spirited individual in that my time organization is whack and I'd work or not work at projects depending on the urgency of what needs to be done and mood.</p>
