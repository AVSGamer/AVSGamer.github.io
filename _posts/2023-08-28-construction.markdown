<h1>27/08/2023 - Construct.</h1>

<p>Diving and using something that someone else made can really be confusing depending on a lot of things but when it comes computer codes, it's way easy to lose track of everything. Just like in machineries, every part has a purpose so if you forget about one then the entire thing just might not work and even worse, cause accidents and issues. Currently thinking of how I want the structure of this website to be.</p>
