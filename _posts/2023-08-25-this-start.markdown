<h3>25/08/2023 - This.Start()</h3>

<p>Alright! So I just read a ton of tutorials on how to get this up! I've been aware of how some folks are able to have their website on GitHub for some time now. So I thought, "What the heck, I already have most of my coding stuff up there so might as well. Awesome solution for a cheap online portfolio too! I wonder if I'll able to run ads on this though! Sure hope I can! But this is all I can manage for today. I really dislike web development and this is somewhat new to me being unable to access the PHPadmin page of this website because I don't actually own the storage it's being held in. But! I've seen what others can do with these and I'm sold to that!".</p>
