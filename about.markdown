<h1>The bloke...</h1>

<p>Hellooooo~ I am Lindsey Loh- I mean my real name is Lorman. If you got the reference to that first sentence we might get along just fine in humor. About myself, right:</p>
<ul><li>Born in the early 90s.</li>
<li>Vague memories of using Windows 95 as his first encounter with a Computer Operating System.</li>
<li>Raised in 2 different countries, both in Asia.</li>
<li>Currently trying to be fluent enough in the Japanese Language to get a language proficiency certification.</li>
<li>Plays a lot of video games, though no longer gets into competitive types. Plays for leisure/fun.</li>
<li>Schizoaffective patient, takes monthly medication for it and some psyche consultations.</li>
<li>Memes help alleviate my depression.</li>
<li>I'd say a pretty grim outlook in life, having barely anything to actually live or die for.</li>
<li>Ego Death? Desireless? Nothing matters, a mind at peace is all everyone really wants.</li>
<li>Despite those above, I managed to be a Bachelor Graduate of Computer Science. Thanks Mom!</li>
<li>Programming or Coding is my way of being productive, aside from the usual monotonous household and personal care stuff.</li>
<li>Can be compulsive with money usage especially during times of no medication.</li>
<li>Drinks a lot of coffee, likes it bittersweet.</li>
<li>Mom's personal remote tech support.</li>
<li>Smokes like a chimney in aspiration of an early exit from life.</li>
<li>Wishes to at least be able to help out my immediate family rather than being a burden. But life sometimes gets us down...</li>
<li>Backlogged writing my computer book for now.</li>
<li><b>DESPISES THE DEVILISH NATURE OF THE WORLD DESPITE PROBABLY BEING A PART OF THE PROBLEM.</b></li>
</ul>
