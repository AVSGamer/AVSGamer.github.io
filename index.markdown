<p>Welcome! These links below are for my mobile phone visitors as the navigation bar on the left won't show up for them.
<br><a href="/lorman-online-portfolio/blog">Projects and Blogs</a> - Is where my own sentiments and projects are.
<br><a href="/lorman-online-portfolio/mypcrig">My Computer Rig</a> - Is where information about my computer setup is.
<br><a href="/lorman-online-portfolio/about">About</a> - Is where you may know more about me in an unhinged way.
</p>
<p>
The following are game tools and softwares that I use which other developers made. May not include stuff on my mobile phone.
</p>

<h1>Other's Game Tools</h1>

<h2>Fate/Grand Order</h2>

<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.fate_grand_automata&hl=en&gl=US">Fate/Grand Automata</a> is a 3rd party script making tool for automating battles and some operations in F/GO. Although it is breaking TOS, a lot argue that this is not modifying anything within the game and only simulates human control over the game and so far not one person have come out claiming that they had been banned explicitly for the reason of using it. This is a really neat project that allows players who are busy with other stuff to still be able to do/play the game while doing something else. The game doesn't really have much multiplayer support or competition and so it is fairly harmless to use this. Just be careful as bans may be warranted if caught doing it especially in livestreaming where one whould show blatant use of it along with complete information about their account. Case in point, the develepors of the game should already be well aware of this neat time saving app but haven't done any sanctions for it. Thank you devs for being sensible beings!</p>

<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.narumi.chaldea&hl=en&gl=US">Chaldea Planner</a> is currently the most complete tool for tracking, managing and planning your in-game resources out there. Earlier versions of this kind organizer had been around longer like <a href="https://fgosim.github.io/Material/">this one</a> but Chaldea is now the most robust one. It's not just a resource planner but an action planner too. Allows you to see the best nodes to farm that drops a specific or combination of materials. I like how I am able to sync my current in-game progress easily without having to manually input every detail in.</p>

<p><a href="https://fgo.square.ovh/">Atlas Academy</a> probably isn't exactly a tool but an information resource. If you want to make your own F/GO tool or app, try their API. They're probably the reason why and how we're able to enjoy all these 3rd party tools that we have now.</p>

<p><a href="https://fate-go.us/news/">Official FGO NA Server Website</a> serves the news you see in-game, use the link if you want to check the news about the game without logging in.</p>

<p><a href="https://gamepress.gg/grandorder/">The Gamepress Wiki for FGO</a> can be pretty slow loading due to all the beautiful looking images that it loads on every page but a great resource for checking skill descriptions and quick look at materials for leveling up skills and ascensions. They also have info on Bond CE effects.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/">FGO Reddit</a> is the number one place to look for event infographics, those images filled with complete information about every event which are vital for the event's 100% progress completion is right here, thanks to clairvoyance(with JP Server being ahead in the timeline) you can expect NA players to always know ahead what is coming and what to do to complete it.</p>

<h2>Honkai Star Rail</h2>

<p><a href="www.hoyolab.com">HoYoLab</a> is the official tool and tracker hub of MiHoYo where you can login and track your in-game characters and progress from their games. Also serves as a social media/forum specifically for their games.</p>

<p><a href="https://starrail.mobilemeta.gg/app">MobileMeta Relic Rater</a> is a neat app where you can input your or other's UID to see their selected support character's relic stats. Also has leaderboards for who has the best relics. Goodluck getting those God-roll Relics!</p>

<h2>Punishing Gray Raven</h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_NAHdVouSp2T6AwStpz9ZMLZ_ca5EzcuHde5obIlero/edit?usp=sharing">PGR Comprehensive Build Sheet</a> by 'probably rexlent', no? Sorry, I've been playing this game on and off. I'm just relying on my bookmarked pages right now. But this Google Spreadsheet contains information on how to build every character in the game to be strongk!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PunishingGrayRaven/">PGR Reddit</a> Goodluck finding the specific tool or resource you need here. Rexlent had a Google Spreadsheet Database of all Characters, Weapons and Memories in the game before but my current link says it's no longer there. He probably moved it somewhere so I'll just update this later to add that in.</p>

<p>I created a tool for this game as well! Check out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z1loqZI2J56A3esVIZq1Zb_S9vrDxyqvoun-gX05YbM/edit?usp=sharing">PGR Equipment Enhancement by PapiRE</a> for your enhancement resource planning. Sorry if it needs to be updated though. Haven't gotten back into playing the game and spending more time on that project after it's initial completion.</p>

<h2>Elder Scrolls Online</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.esoui.com/addons.php">ESOUI</a> is all you need for your ESO Quality of Life addons, aside from the base game ofcourse. I am not going through what I find to be absolutely essential addons right now as I am currently not updated with the game. It's been a year since I last played this game but I am very happy to see that the addon I made myself for this game is still alive and doing well. Here's <a href="https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info3072-XPTracker.html">XP Tracker</a> which I made for the game last year. This site used to promote an addon manager app called Minion, don't seem to see it now.</p>

<h1>Freewares I Rely On</h1>

<h2>Video and Image Editing</h2>

<h4>GIMP</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Their Official Website</a> is the only place to download any freeware to avoid downloading those infected with malware. That's why I include the links to where you can find these resources. GIMP is- AFAIK an opensource, Freeware- it's totally free and anyone can check anytime whether there is anything wrong with it's coding. I actually grew up and got accustomed to using Photoshop's with it's layers and easy to understand UI and flow. But after seeing the price-tags of those kinds of software, I opted for a more budget friendly option. What's more friendly than FREE? as long as it doesn't come laden with malware it's awesome! Although I often find myself scratching my head looking for instructions on how to manipulate the image the way I want in this application, it is quite robust as well like Photoshoop in terms of capabilities.</p>

<h4>DaVinci Resolve</h4>

<p>I would pretty much say the exact same thing as I said with the previous freeware mentioned here for <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve">this free video editing software.</a> You'll have to buy a license if you want better quality renditions or need higher resolutions AFAIK. But for most basic video editing tasks that doesn't have to look very realistic. This is a freeware you can use. I actually grew up playing with Sony Vegas Studio but again, the price for a license of that!</p>

<h2>Online Streaming</h2>

<h4>Open Broadcasting Software or OBS</h4>

<p><a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> is probably the most used streaming software right now all over the web due to it being totally free, open-source and very capable for your streaming needs. Unless you want to stream to multiple platforms at the same time then maybe you should look for multi-platform streaming services that you can use alongside OBS, most of them aren't free though and if there is free option then it's likely limited in capability.</p>

<h2>Other/Tools</h2>

<h4>Brave Browser</h4>

<p>For a while, <a href="https://brave.com/">this</a> web browser was recommended by a lot of InfoSec "experts" over at my country's InfoSec Facebook Group so I eventually tried it out. And I love it! Seeing stats like "How much bandwidth have you saved? Trackers Blocked? Time Saved?" every time I open a new tab is whimsical and it's really nice that it comes with it's own crypto wallet manager.</p>

<h4>Razer Synapse</h4>

<p>My main reason for still using <a href="https://www.razer.com/synapse-3">Razer's</a> full suite of proprietary programs is for keeping their drivers up to date and controlling my PC Unit's ARGB Effects with the Razer ARGB Controller Hub that I use. Honestly like 99%, never used softwares for input devices' macro programming functionality. The heatmap that shows which keys are pressed the most on your keyboard is pretty nice though.<p>

<h4>ASRock RGB Configurator</h4>

<p>I cannot provide a download link for this one even if I force it as it seems like their site's not functional right now. The way you are supposed to download a version of this is depending on your Motherboard, so if you are unsure or not using an ASRock Motherboard in your PC Unit, then you would probably use a different RGB Configurator. Go to your Motherboard's Official Manufacturer website and lookup your motherboard model then check for downloadables under it. I use this primarily for mix/matching or just simply turning off RGB lights on my CPU Unit that the Razer Synapse cannot control. That said I barely actually "use" it at all.</p>

<h4>Visual Studio Code</h4>

<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">This</a> is a refined text editing program primarily used for scripting or writing computer code, unlike Microsoft Word which is meant for Humans to process. You can enhance this editor with addons or plugins as well to suite your needs no matter what computer language you are working with. When programming, or reading code, differences in text colors are only visible when the editor recognizes what each code is a part of. Otherwise you're reading like plain notepad with only a single color throughout all the text which is not helpful for programmers at all. Highlighting helps identify problems and see the structure of the code better.</p>

<h4>GitHub Desktop</h4>

<p><a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> is an app that I am only recently starting to use more frequently because of my usage of their website. It allows me to easily sync the files on my computer and on their website and manage my coding projects. I use this along with <a href="https://git-scm.com/">GitBash</a>, which is something peculiar since I have no idea why I have to. AFAIK VS Code also has it's own CLI and maybe even GitHub Desktop have it's own CLI too. Still too new when it comes to working with these tools and I hope to better understand them as I continue using them.</p>

<h4>CCleaner</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/">This</a> is for quick cleanup of my computer's software side performance. Simple tasks that you can do to speed up your computer by cleaning it up inside it's system is what this tool does. Ofcourse you could always do those without having to install these but I rely on it since I am not always up-to-date when it comes to those techniques.</p>

<h4>CPU-Z</h4>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html">this</a> mainly for showing my computer rig's specifications, and I like how it also shows my Ram Sticks' Manufacturer and which are slotted in what slot.<p>

<h4>Disk Drill</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.cleverfiles.com/data-recovery-software.html">Disk Drill</a> is a tool you can use to recover deleted files from your storage media such as HDD, SDD, USB Flash Drives, External Disk Drives, etc. I've tried it and it works, even though their website design choice is throwing me a little bit of "bloatware alert: possibly harmful" ideas. Now how you would use this recover your files is up to your technique. Say someone's computer won't boot and they need to recover some files from storage before resetting. Then you might need another device or computer that would run this while hooking up the storage device of the problematic one.</p>

<h4>TeamViewer</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.teamviewer.com/apac/">TeamViewer</a> is a godsend of an app, I've been using it for years already with a free account with no problems whatsoever. Remote controlling another's Computer System through internet with this app? Couldn't be any more secure and efficient I think. Everytime my mother needs help with her computer, WiFi Setting, or printer setup, this is what I use along with her hands for stuff that needs physical interaction with the devices over at her location.</p>

<h4>XAMPP</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/">XAMPP</a> is what we used back in college during our web development course. It allows you to run a local server where you dev-deploy a website that you are making or working on. You can build your website using this the hard way which is barebones pure html, css, and javascript files only. Or you can also use Wordpress on it. As long as the student understands the hows of HTML, JS, and CSS and even XML working together to create websites.</p>

<h4>KMSPico-35</h4>

<p><a href="https://bit.ly/kmspico-35">This licensing script/tool</a> which is hosted on one of my repositories here is a version of the tool used to remove the "Activate Windows" and other Microsoft Product's license requirements. Is it legal? No. Businesses should avoid using illegally licensed softwares. There's a rabbit hole to this as to why the people over at Microsoft can easily detect this yet has done nothing to prevent it. This is not my creation and I am only hosting on my repository for safe-record-keeping that this did exist as it seems like looking for it online isn't as easy as it was before anymore. In the 'Licensed Softwares I Use' section below, are softwares that I actually bought legal licenses for whether it's for OEM or straight-up paying the publisher/developers.</p>

<h1>Licensed Softwares I Use</h1>

<h4>Microsoft Operating System - Win11 Pro</h4>
<h4>Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016</h4>
<h4>EMU8086 - Assembly Language Coding Environment</h4>
