<p>Welcome! This is for my mobile phone visitors as the navigation bar on the left won't show up for them.
<br><a href="/lorman-online-portfolio/blog">Projects and Blogs</a> - Is where my own sentiments and projects are.
<br><a href="/lorman-online-portfolio/rig">My Computer Rig</a> - Is where information about my computer setup is.
<br><a href="/lorman-online-portfolio/about">About</a> - Is where you may know more about me in an unhinged way.
</p>
<p>
The following are game tools and softwares that I use which other developers made. May not include stuff on my mobile phone.
</p>

<h1>Other's Game Tools</h1>

<h2>Fate/Grand Order</h2>

<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.fate_grand_automata&hl=en&gl=US">Fate/Grand Automata</a> is a 3rd party script making tool for automating battles and some operations in F/GO. Although it is breaking TOS, a lot argue that this is not modifying anything within the game and only simulates human control over the game and so far not one person have come out claiming that they had been banned explicitly for the reason of using it. This is a really neat project that allows players who are busy with other stuff to still be able to do/play the game while doing something else. The game doesn't really have much multiplayer support or competition and so it is fairly harmless to use this. Just be careful as bans may be warranted if caught doing it especially in livestreaming where one whould show blatant use of it along with complete information about their account. Case in point, the develepors of the game should already be well aware of this neat time saving app but haven't done any sanctions for it. Thank you devs for being sensible beings!</p>

<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.narumi.chaldea&hl=en&gl=US">Chaldea Planner</a> is currently the most complete tool for tracking, managing and planning your in-game resources out there. Earlier versions of this kind organizer had been around longer like <a href="https://fgosim.github.io/Material/">this one</a> but Chaldea is now the most robust one. It's not just a resource planner but an action planner too. Allows you to see the best nodes to farm that drops a specific or combination of materials. I like how I am able to sync my current in-game progress easily without having to manually input every detail in.</p>

<p><a href="https://fgo.square.ovh/">Atlas Academy</a> probably isn't exactly a tool but an information resource. If you want to make your own F/GO tool or app, try their API. They're probably the reason why and how we're able to enjoy all these 3rd party tools that we have now.</p>

<p><a href="https://fate-go.us/news/">Official FGO NA Server Website</a> serves the news you see in-game, use the link if you want to check the news about the game without logging in.</p>

<p><a href="https://gamepress.gg/grandorder/">The Gamepress Wiki for FGO</a> can be pretty slow loading due to all the beautiful looking images that it loads on every page but a great resource for checking skill descriptions and quick look at materials for leveling up skills and ascensions. They also have info on Bond CE effects.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/">FGO Reddit</a> is the number one place to look for event infographics, those images filled with complete information about every event which are vital for the event's 100% progress completion is right here, thanks to clairvoyance(with JP Server being ahead in the timeline) you can expect NA players to always know ahead what is coming and what to do to complete it.</p>

<h2>Honkai Star Rail</h2>

<p><a href="www.hoyolab.com">HoYoLab</a> is the official tool and tracker hub of MiHoYo where you can login and track your in-game characters and progress from their games. Also serves as a social media/forum specifically for their games.</p>

<p><a href="https://starrail.mobilemeta.gg/app">MobileMeta Relic Rater</a> is a neat app where you can input your or other's UID to see their selected support character's relic stats. Also has leaderboards for who has the best relics. Goodluck getting those God-roll Relics!</p>

<h2>Punishing Gray Raven</h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_NAHdVouSp2T6AwStpz9ZMLZ_ca5EzcuHde5obIlero/edit?usp=sharing">PGR Comprehensive Build Sheet</a> by 'probably rexlent', no? Sorry, I've been playing this game on and off. I'm just relying on my bookmarked pages right now. But this Google Spreadsheet contains information on how to build every character in the game to be strongk!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PunishingGrayRaven/">PGR Reddit</a> Goodluck finding the specific tool or resource you need here. Rexlent had a Google Spreadsheet Database of all Characters, Weapons and Memories in the game before but my current link says it's no longer there. He probably moved it somewhere so I'll just update this later to add that in.</p>

<p>I created a tool for this game as well! Check out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z1loqZI2J56A3esVIZq1Zb_S9vrDxyqvoun-gX05YbM/edit?usp=sharing">PGR Equipment Enhancement by PapiRE</a> for your enhancement resource planning. Sorry if it needs to be updated though. Haven't gotten back into playing the game and spending more time on that project after it's initial completion.</p>

<h2>Elder Scrolls Online</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.esoui.com/addons.php">ESOUI</a> is all you need for your ESO Quality of Life addons, aside from the base game ofcourse. I am not going through what I find to be absolutely essential addons right now as I am currently not updated with the game. It's been a year since I last played this game but I am very happy to see that the addon I made myself for this game is still alive and doing well. Here's <a href="https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info3072-XPTracker.html">XP Tracker</a> which I made for the game last year. This site used to promote an addon manager app called Minion, don't seem to see it now.</p>
